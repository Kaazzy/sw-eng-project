# Branch Initialization Guide

This guide is for the **repository administrator** to initialize the branch structure for the first time.

## Overview

After merging this PR, you'll need to create the three development branches (`front`, `back`, `api`) based on the `main` branch. This is a one-time setup.

## Prerequisites

- Merge this PR to create the initial documentation
- Have admin access to the repository
- Have Git installed locally

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Update Your Local Repository

```bash
# Navigate to your local repository
cd sw-eng-project

# Fetch the latest changes
git fetch origin

# Switch to main branch (or the branch where docs were merged)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

### Step 2: Create the Development Branches

Create each development branch from `main`:

```bash
# Create front branch
git checkout -b front
git push -u origin front

# Create back branch
git checkout main
git checkout -b back
git push -u origin back

# Create api branch
git checkout main
git checkout -b api
git push -u origin api
```

### Step 3: Verify Branch Creation

```bash
# List all branches
git branch -a

# You should see:
# * api
#   back
#   front
#   main
#   remotes/origin/api
#   remotes/origin/back
#   remotes/origin/front
#   remotes/origin/main
```

### Step 4: Set Branch Protection Rules

Follow the detailed instructions in [REPOSITORY_SETUP.md](REPOSITORY_SETUP.md) to configure:

1. Branch protection for `main` (2 approvals required)
2. Branch protection for `front`, `back`, `api` (1 approval required)
3. Additional repository settings

**Quick Link**: Go to GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Add rule

### Step 5: Configure Default Branch (Optional)

If `main` is not the default branch:

1. Go to GitHub repository Settings
2. Click "Branches" in sidebar
3. Under "Default branch", click the switch icon
4. Select `main`
5. Click "Update" and confirm

### Step 6: Notify Team Members

Once setup is complete, inform your team:

1. Share the repository URL
2. Point them to the [BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md](BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md)
3. Point them to the [GIT_CHEATSHEET.md](GIT_CHEATSHEET.md) for quick reference
4. Recommend they read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

**Example message to team:**
```
Hi team! üëã

Our repository branch structure is now ready:

üìÅ Repository: https://github.com/Kaazzy/sw-eng-project
üìã Branches: main, front, back, api

Please:
1. Clone the repository
2. Read the Branching Strategy guide: BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md
3. Check out the Git Cheatsheet: GIT_CHEATSHEET.md

When starting work:
- Frontend ‚Üí create feature branches from 'front'
- Backend ‚Üí create feature branches from 'back'  
- API ‚Üí create feature branches from 'api'

Create PRs for code review before merging!

Questions? Check CONTRIBUTING.md or ask in our chat.
```

## Alternative: Script-Based Setup

If you prefer, you can use this script to create all branches at once:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Creating branch structure for sw-eng-project..."

# Ensure we're on main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create and push front branch
echo "Creating front branch..."
git checkout -b front
git push -u origin front

# Create and push back branch
echo "Creating back branch..."
git checkout main
git checkout -b back
git push -u origin back

# Create and push api branch
echo "Creating api branch..."
git checkout main
git checkout -b api
git push -u origin api

# Return to main
git checkout main

echo "‚úÖ All branches created successfully!"
echo ""
echo "Branches created:"
git branch -a | grep -E '(front|back|api|main)'

echo ""
echo "Next steps:"
echo "1. Configure branch protection rules (see REPOSITORY_SETUP.md)"
echo "2. Add team members as collaborators"
echo "3. Notify team that repository is ready"
```

Save this as `setup-branches.sh`, make it executable, and run:

```bash
chmod +x setup-branches.sh
./setup-branches.sh
```

## Verification Checklist

After completing the setup, verify:

- [ ] All four branches exist (main, front, back, api)
- [ ] `main` is the default branch
- [ ] Branch protection rules are configured
- [ ] All 5 team members have repository access
- [ ] Pull request template is visible when creating PRs
- [ ] Team has been notified with documentation links

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Branch already exists
**Solution**: If a branch already exists, you can skip creating it or delete and recreate:
```bash
git push origin --delete front  # Delete remote branch
git branch -D front            # Delete local branch
# Then create fresh
```

### Problem: Permission denied when pushing
**Solution**: Ensure you have admin rights to the repository.

### Problem: Cannot set branch protection
**Solution**: Only repository admins can set branch protection rules. Check your repository permissions.

## Team Member Onboarding

When new team members join, have them:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kaazzy/sw-eng-project.git
   cd sw-eng-project
   ```

2. **Fetch all branches**
   ```bash
   git fetch --all
   ```

3. **Set up local tracking branches**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b front origin/front
   git checkout -b back origin/back
   git checkout -b api origin/api
   git checkout -b main origin/main
   ```

4. **Verify setup**
   ```bash
   git branch -a
   ```

5. **Read documentation**
   - [BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md](BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md) - Understand the workflow
   - [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) - Learn how to contribute
   - [GIT_CHEATSHEET.md](GIT_CHEATSHEET.md) - Quick reference

## Maintenance

### Adding New Team Members

1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Collaborators and teams
2. Click "Add people"
3. Enter their GitHub username
4. Set permission to "Write"
5. Send them onboarding instructions

### Updating Documentation

Documentation should be kept in the `main` branch:

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Update documentation files
3. Create PR to `main`
4. Merge after review

### Regular Maintenance

- **Weekly**: Check for stale branches and delete merged feature branches
- **Monthly**: Review branch protection rules
- **Quarterly**: Review and update documentation as team workflow evolves

## Need Help?

- Review [REPOSITORY_SETUP.md](REPOSITORY_SETUP.md) for detailed GitHub configuration
- Check [BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md](BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md) for workflow details
- Contact repository administrator

---

**Important**: This is a one-time setup. Once complete, the team can start working using the standard workflow described in BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md.
