ASP.NET Team Project - Simple and Clean Branch Structure

## Project Overview

This is an ASP.NET project developed by a 5-member team using a streamlined branching strategy to facilitate smooth collaboration.

## Branching Strategy

We use a simple 4-branch structure:
- **main**: Production-ready code
- **front**: Frontend development
- **back**: Backend development
- **api**: API development

ðŸ“– **[Read the complete Branching Strategy Guide](BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md)** for detailed workflow instructions, examples, and best practices.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Kaazzy/sw-eng-project.git
cd sw-eng-project

# Fetch all branches
git fetch --all

# Check out the branch relevant to your work
git checkout front    # for frontend work
git checkout back     # for backend work
git checkout api      # for API work
```
