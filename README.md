ASP.NET Team Project - Simple and Clean Branch Structure

## Project Overview

This is an ASP.NET project developed by a 5-member team using a streamlined branching strategy to facilitate smooth collaboration.

## Branching Strategy

We use a simple 4-branch structure:
- **main**: Production-ready code
- **front**: Frontend development
- **back**: Backend development
- **api**: API development
