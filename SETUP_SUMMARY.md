### üõ†Ô∏è Templates Created

- **.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md** - Standardized PR template for code reviews

## The 4-Branch Structure

### Branch Purposes

1. **main** - Production-ready code
   - Most protected
   - Requires 2 approvals for merges
   - Only receives merges from front/back/api after testing

2. **front** - Frontend development
   - For UI, views, client-side code
   - Requires 1 approval for merges
   - Merges to main for releases

3. **back** - Backend development
   - For business logic, services, data processing
   - Requires 1 approval for merges
   - Merges to main for releases

4. **api** - API development
   - For REST APIs, controllers, endpoints
   - Requires 1 approval for merges
   - Merges to main for releases

### Feature Branch Workflow

```
Developer creates feature branch from front/back/api
           ‚Üì
      Develop feature
           ‚Üì
      Push to remote
           ‚Üì
    Create Pull Request
           ‚Üì
      Code Review (1 approval)
           ‚Üì
    Merge to front/back/api
           ‚Üì
    Integration testing
           ‚Üì
    PR to main (2 approvals)
           ‚Üì
    Production deployment
```

## What You Need to Do Next

### For Repository Administrators

1. **Merge this PR** to the base branch
2. **Create the branches** following [BRANCH_INITIALIZATION.md](BRANCH_INITIALIZATION.md)
   - Create `main` branch (if not exists)
   - Create `front` branch
   - Create `back` branch
   - Create `api` branch

3. **Set up branch protection** following [REPOSITORY_SETUP.md](REPOSITORY_SETUP.md)
   - Configure main branch (2 approvals required)
   - Configure front, back, api branches (1 approval required)

4. **Add team members** as collaborators with Write access

5. **Notify the team** that the repository is ready
   - Share the repository URL
   - Point them to [BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md](BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md)
   - Point them to [GIT_CHEATSHEET.md](GIT_CHEATSHEET.md)

### For Team Members

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kaazzy/sw-eng-project.git
   cd sw-eng-project
   ```

2. **Read the documentation**
   - Start with [BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md](BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md)
   - Bookmark [GIT_CHEATSHEET.md](GIT_CHEATSHEET.md)
   - Review [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

3. **Set up local branches**
   ```bash
   git fetch --all
   git checkout -b front origin/front
   git checkout -b back origin/back
   git checkout -b api origin/api
   git checkout -b main origin/main
   ```

4. **Start working**
   - Pick your task
   - Create feature branch from appropriate base (front/back/api)
   - Develop, test, commit, push
   - Create PR for code review

## Common First-Day Questions

### Q: Which branch should I use for my work?
**A:** 
- Frontend work (UI, views, client code) ‚Üí `front` branch
- Backend work (services, business logic) ‚Üí `back` branch
- API work (endpoints, controllers) ‚Üí `api` branch

### Q: How do I create a new feature?
**A:** Follow these steps:
```bash
git checkout front  # or back/api
git pull origin front
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# Make changes
git commit -m "Your message"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
# Create PR on GitHub
```

### Q: Who approves my pull requests?
**A:**
- PRs to front/back/api ‚Üí Need 1 team member approval
- PRs to main ‚Üí Need 2 team member approvals

### Q: When should we merge to main?
**A:** Only after thorough testing on the development branch (front/back/api). Main should always be production-ready.

### Q: What if I have an urgent bug fix for production?
**A:** Create a hotfix branch from `main`, fix it, create PR to `main`, and then sync back to development branches. See [BRANCH_DIAGRAM.md](BRANCH_DIAGRAM.md) for hotfix workflow.

### Q: Can I work on multiple features at once?
**A:** Yes! Create separate feature branches:
```bash
feature/login-page
feature/user-profile
fix/authentication-bug
```

## Team Workflow Example

### Scenario: Building a New Feature

**Frontend Developer:**
```bash
git checkout front
git checkout -b feature/new-dashboard-ui
# Develop the UI
git commit -m "Add new dashboard UI components"
git push origin feature/new-dashboard-ui
# Create PR: feature/new-dashboard-ui ‚Üí front
```

**Backend Developer:**
```bash
git checkout back
git checkout -b feature/dashboard-data-service
# Develop the service
git commit -m "Add dashboard data aggregation service"
git push origin feature/dashboard-data-service
# Create PR: feature/dashboard-data-service ‚Üí back
```

**API Developer:**
```bash
git checkout api
git checkout -b feature/dashboard-api-endpoints
# Develop the endpoints
git commit -m "Add dashboard API endpoints"
git push origin feature/dashboard-api-endpoints
# Create PR: feature/dashboard-api-endpoints ‚Üí api
```

**After all PRs are approved and merged:**
- Test integration on front/back/api branches
- When ready, create PRs: front ‚Üí main, back ‚Üí main, api ‚Üí main
- After 2 approvals each, merge to main
- Deploy to production! üöÄ

## Support

If you have questions:
1. Check the relevant documentation file
2. Ask in team chat
3. Reach out to repository administrator
4. Create a GitHub discussion (if enabled)

## Maintenance

This setup requires minimal maintenance:
- **Weekly**: Delete merged feature branches
- **Monthly**: Review and clean up stale branches
- **Quarterly**: Update documentation based on team feedback

---

**Congratulations!** üéâ Your repository is now set up with a clean, simple branching strategy that will help your 5-member team collaborate smoothly on your ASP.NET project.

**Next Step**: Repository admin should follow [BRANCH_INITIALIZATION.md](BRANCH_INITIALIZATION.md) to create the branches.
